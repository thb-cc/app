This project utilizes [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) to generate this static documentation website that is served via [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages).
The code and content of the website are maintained in the [/website](https://github.com/thb-cc/app/tree/main/website) directory of the repository.

To start a local development server execute `npm run start`.

To deploy your changes run `npm run deploy`.
Depending on your git setup you may need to use [environment settings](https://docusaurus.io/docs/deployment#environment-settings).

Deployments are stored at and served from the branch [gh-pages](https://github.com/thb-cc/app/tree/gh-pages).
